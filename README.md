# Major League Baseball 2019 Analysis
This is a repository for Python code for my data analytics course achievement 6 open source data analysis.
### Achievement 6 Description
This repository is for Achievement 6 of my data analytics course.  For this achievement, I sourced my own major league baseball data, created research questions based on the data, and analyzed.  I created a final Tableau presentation to present my research findings. 
### Data
For this analysis, I used open source major league baseball 2019 batting data from Kaggle.  Source [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnadamek/game-by-game-mlb-batter-data-20172020?select=batting_2020.csv)
### Tools
The following python libraries were used for this analysis:
pandas - for data analysis
seaborn - for visualizations
matplotlib
sklearn - for clustering
pylab
numpy
### Code
The code for this analysis is available in the scripts folder of Achievement 6 Basbeall Analysis Folder. 
### Deliverable 
Tableau Public was used to create a dashboard to present data.  Not all script results were presented in the story, only relevant analysis. Link [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BaseballAnalysisStory_16642207681070/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
### Time Series Analysis
A time series analysis was learned during this project.  Since the data for the baseball analysis only contianed 2019 data, additional and non related data was used for the time series analysis which can be viewed in the time series folder.
